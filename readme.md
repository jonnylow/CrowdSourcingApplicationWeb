## Installation & Configuration

1. You can create a local clone of this repository on your computer by running: `git clone https://github.com/jonnylow/CrowdSourcingApplicationWeb.git`

  This will create a directory with the same name as the cloned repository in the current directory you ran the command.
  * For example, if you were to run the command in `wamp/www` directory, it would clone the repository down into the directory `CrowdSourcingApplicationWeb`, then convert it to a Git repository for you.

2. Install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) by following the instructions given in its download page. **_If you have already installed this, you can skip this step._**
3. After you have installed composer and have its PATH environment variable set up, install the project dependencies by running Composer: `composer install` in the directory `CrowdSourcingApplicationWeb`.

4. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). **_If you have already installed this, you can skip this step._**

5. Install additional project dependencies by running: `npm install` in the directory `CrowdSourcingApplicationWeb`.

6. Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env`. Feel free to modify the environment variables in the file, as needed for your own local server, as well as your production environment.
